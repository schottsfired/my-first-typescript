# My First TypeScript

## Getting Started
Install Node on OSX with `brew install node`

Install TypeScript with `npm install -g typescript` (g for global)

Compile a `.ts` file with `tsc file.ts` (this turns the file into JavaScript `.js`)

Auto-compile a `.ts` file with `tsc file.ts -w` (w for watch)

Include compiled `.js` file in `index.html`, then open in browser. Use dev tools to view console output of TypeScript (JavaScript) program.
